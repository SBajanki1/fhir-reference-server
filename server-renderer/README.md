# FHIR Server/Renderer
> Run a local FHIR artefact renderer and serve the rendered artefacts

A combined renderer and FHIR server running in a single process, designed for data modellers to run locally and test rendering of resources as they are created/modified. This is a wrapper around the reference-server-lib and profile-renderer-lib libraries with some additional functionality.
